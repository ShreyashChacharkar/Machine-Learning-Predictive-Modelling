# About
Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a maintenance strategy that uses data analysis to predict when a machine or equipment is likely to fail. This allows for preventive maintenance to be performed before the failure occurs, avoiding costly downtime and repairs. By combining PdM with ML, it is possible to develop models that can accurately predict machine failures days, weeks, or even months in advance. This allows organizations to schedule preventive maintenance at the most opportune time, minimizing downtime and maximizing uptime.
